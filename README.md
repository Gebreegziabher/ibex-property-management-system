# Property Management System

This project is developed for the purpose of a course project at Maharishi International University, proposed by this lovely professor- https://github.com/muhyidean/. We named the application - IBex. Property management portal is a web-based java and e√° project where house owners and customers can exchange information effectively and inexpensively. This system provides a user-friendly interface, satisfying the needs of the consumers.

The front-end is developed using ReactJs and the back-end is developed using Spring boot.

The overall functionality of the system is hosted in this 11 minutes video - https://loom.com/share/cf4790a4eab5458185214cefa12cce18
